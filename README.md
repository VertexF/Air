# The Air Engine

A 3D Vulkan game engine. This game engine is in active development, the code in the project should not be considered final.\
The idea behind this game engine is combine the physics work I did on the [Wind game engine](https://github.com/VertexF/Wind) and the general software architecture ideas I implemented in the [Tempest game engine](https://github.com/VertexF/Tempest) and even some of the graphics programming I did on the [Gust game engine](https://github.com/VertexF/Gust) and bring them all into one game engine that has the strength of all 3. One game engine to rule them all.

I keep semi-regular updates on my game development journey on my YouTube channel [EscPointDev](https://www.youtube.com/@EscPointDev) So if you are more interested in further details about what I'm doing and I'm doing check out a video.
